<p>But don’t fall into a trap of elevating or inventing a hobby just because you think it’s the “right” one. “I use what I call the two-minute rule here with my clients. If you can talk about whatever it is for two minutes passionately, it’s worth mentioning,” Fink says. If you can’t, then choose something else. You’ll come across as more genuine than trying to force it. And definitely don’t try to pad out your answer by talking more about the job: “Answering in a way that ties directly to the job description may end up coming across as disingenuous or inauthentic,” Fink says.</p>
